# Game Hub 

GameHub is a video game discovery web app that helps you find new and interesting games to play. With GameHub, you can search for games by platform, genre, and more. 

This is the project where I demonstrate my React and Typescript skills. 

The application is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) on the following url: https://game-hub-zeta-red.vercel.app

## About the Project 

I have designed this project to demonstrate you everything I had to learn to become a proficient React developer. This project is the first part of a two-part series, covering the fundamentals. I show here that I know how to:

- Build front-end apps with React and TypeScript
- Build reusable function components
- Style your components using vanilla CSS, CSS modules, and CSS-in-JS
- Manage component state
- Build forms with React Hook Forms
- Implement form validation using Zod
- Connect your React apps to the backend
- Deploy your React apps
- Use VSCode shortcuts to increase your productivity
- Write clean code like a pro
- Apply best practices
